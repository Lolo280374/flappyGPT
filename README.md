## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/Lolo280374/flappybird_pygame/blob/main/assets/sprites/showcase.png?raw=true)

This is a small game I decided to try and code with chatGPT to test the capabilities of the AI, and of my debugging skills. It took less than 1 day to get this project running, and it might contains bugs.

Here's why I did it:

* To simply test the capabilities of OpenAI's public model, and how can it actually be helpful
* To see if chatGPT and me can debug problems created by this code
* And to make a funny game that might help in future carrers!

Of course, a big part of this project has been to wanting to make it public. So, that's why anyone can download it, edit it, and make pull requests (or suggestions) to the main repo! All you have to keep in mind, is to credit me (according to the License).

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

This game has fully been made in Python.
